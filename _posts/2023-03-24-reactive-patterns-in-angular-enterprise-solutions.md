**Simplified Courses** had the opportunity to give a talk at the awesome Belgian [ng-be](https://ng-be.org/){:target="_blank"} Angular conference.

The topic of our choice was **"Reactive Patterns in Angular Enterprise Solutions**" where we tackle one of the biggest issues when it comes to Angular development.
We tackled the fact that RxJS code can be pretty darn hard!

Understanding RxJS as a technology is one thing.
But code written with RxJS can be very complex.
We have:
- Mapping operators
- Combination operators
- Different types of subjects
- Multicasting
- to avoid memory leaks
- Error handling

In this talk, we will start from a template that contains complexity and redundancy and refactor everything toward opinionated reactive patterns.

We are extremely proud of these patterns and teach them in our training as well.

## Check the talk

This session will only take 25 minutes of your time. If you are interested we love to have a talk about this and we love to hear your opinion! **Enjoy the talk!**
