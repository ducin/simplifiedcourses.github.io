Angular Change Detection is hard, and there is not that much documentation about it.
I even had to reverse-engineer the Angular source code to know what was going on, so I decided
to write a book about it. You can [check it here](https://www.simplified.courses/angular-change-detection-simplified-e-book){:target="_blank"}
[Bartosz WasiLew](https://twitter.com/bartosz_wasilew){:target="_blank"} challenged us to make a video in under 5 minutes so we did.

Before we present the video we like to list a few articles where we either explain Angular Change Detection or optimise for Change Detection:
