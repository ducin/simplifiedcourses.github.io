## Explaining the problem

In a previous article, we have written about [Reactive ViewModels for Ui components in Angular](https://blog.simplified.courses/reactive-viewmodels-for-ui-components-in-angular/). If you haven't read this article yet, we recommend you read it first, since this article is an improvement on the other one. With a ViewModel, we mean a **Reactive model specifically created for the view (template)**. In short, it is an RxJS Observable that contains all the properties that our template needs to render correctly. It contains all the properties and only those properties.

Some of the advantages are:
- Only one async pipe is needed.
- Only one subscription is created.
- No more [null issues with the async pipe](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61780339/angular-ivy-stricttemplates-true-type-boolean-null-is-not-assignable-to-type).
- Clear separation of concerns.
- We can move logic from the template to the ViewModel of the class instance.

Here we can see some short code for a ViewModel of a pager component:
(Pay attention to the single subscription in the `*ngIf` directive)

```html
<ng-container *ngIf="vm$|async as vm">
    Showing {%raw%}{{ vm.itemFrom }}{%endraw%}
    to {%raw%}{{ vm.itemTo }}{%endraw%} of 
    {%raw%}{{ vm.total }}{%endraw%} entries
    ...
</ng-container>
```

In the article mentioned before, we used a combination of setters and **BehaviorSubjects** to create observables from our **@Input()** properties. We then used the `combineLatest` operator to create our ViewModel and used the `distinctUntilChanged` operator to optimize it for performance.
While this can be seen as a nice approach, there are still a few problems with this way of creating ViewModels:

- Setters of inputs can be called multiple times in one Change Detection cycle.
  - This can result in multiple emissions of the `combineLatest` operator in one Change Detection cycle.
  - This can result in multiple calculations of the ViewModel in one Change Detection cycle.
  - This will result in multiple `markForCheck()` executions in one Change Detection cycle, even though this is a trivial performance loss.
- Creating a setter and a BehaviorSubject for every **@Input()** property results in boilerplate code.
- Manual `combineLatest()` with `distinctUntilChanged` results in boilerplate and RxJS complexity. This could be automated.

The fact that the setters can be called multiple times per Change Detection cycle could be fixed by using a `debounceTime(0)` statement but this results in:
- Unnecessary boilerplate code
- A new Change Detection cycle is being triggered. (added to the macrotask queue of the javascript event loop)
- It's a hack...

## The goal of this article 

In this article, we will create **one** observable that is populated with the values of the **@Input()** properties. We will continue on the example of the previous article which is a pager component.
What we want to achieve is the following:
- The Observable should emit even if there are Inputs that are not being set (Optional inputs).
- The Observable should **emit only once per Change Detection cycle**.
- The Observable should emit initially with the initial values
- The Observable should emit after initialization only if one of the inputs has actually changed.
- We want to remove as much boilerplate code as possible

In this article, we will cover the creation of an **InputStateModel** and we will see how we can remove boilerplate by using **Typescript Decorators**. This is the first article of a series of multiple articles: In the next article, we will dive into the component state and later on we will see how we can combine the Input state, the component state and ViewModels in Angular. 

## The ngOnChanges life cycle hook

The default way to know if any **@Input()** properties have gotten new data in Angular would be the use of the `ngOnChanges` lifecycle hook. This lifecycle hook gets a `SimpleChanges` parameter passed that contains the current changes and the previous changes for every input. The beautiful thing about this hook is that it only **gets executed once per Change Detection cycle**.
Using this lifecycle hook can get brittle because it is not typed. Let's create our own `TypedSimpleChanges` interface that takes a generic type to fix this.
Let's add a `PagerInputState` type as well to complete it.

```typescript
// Interface for typed simple changes
export interface TypedSimpleChanges<T> extends SimpleChanges {}

// Type for the Observable that will hold the input state
type PagerInputState = {
  itemsPerPage: number;
  total: number;
  pageIndex: number;
}


export class PagerComponent implements OnChanges {
  ...
  public ngOnChanges(changes: TypedSimpleChanges<PagerInputState>): void {}
}
```

In the `ngOnChanges` life cycle hook we want to feed some kind of Observable with data that we can consume or that we can generate a ViewModel from.

We want to create an `InputStateModel` class that is an injectable that is provided on `PagerComponent`. We want to inject it into the pager component but we also want it to be destroyed when the `PageComponent` gets destroyed. When we provide the `InputStateModel`in the `providers` as shown below, the `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hook will get executed when `PagerComponent` gets destroyed. In other words: The instance of `InputStateModel` will get destroyed when the instance of `PagerComponent` gets destroyed. We can also see that we use the `ngOnChanges` life cycle hook to pass the simple changes to the `update()` function of `this.inputStateModel`.

```typescript
@Component({â€¦
  providers: [InputStateModel]
})
export class PagerComponent implements OnChanges {
  // Inject the InputStateModel of type PagerInputState
  private readonly inputStateModel = inject(InputStateModel<PagerInputState>);
  private readonly inputState$ = this.inputStateModel.state$;

  @Input() public itemsPerPage: number = 0;
  @Input() public total: number = 0;
  @Input() public pageIndex: number = 0;

  // Update the type to TypedSimpleChanges that is generic
  public ngOnChanges(changes: TypedSimpleChanges<PagerInputState>): void {
    // Pass the changes to the inputStateModel that will handle everything.
    this.inputStateModel.update(changes);
  }

  // generate ViewModel from the inputState$
  public readonly vm$: Observable<ViewModel> = this.inputState$.pipe(
    map(({ itemsPerPage, total, pageIndex }) => {...})
  );
}
```

The code above is the first version of how we can consume the `InputStateModel`. We still have to implement the `InputStateModel` later, but we can see that we have reduced the boilerplate code a lot:
- There are no more BehaviorSubjects.
- There ar no more setters.
- There are no more `combineLatest()` nor `distinctUntilChanged()` operators to be seen.
- We can just use the `map()` operator to create the `vm$` ViewModel from `this.inputState$`.

**Most importantly: It will only be called once per Change Detection cycle**.

## Implementing InputStateModel

Before we start implementing this **Injectable**, let's list the features of this class:
- It should create a BehaviorSubject that holds the input state when the `update` function is called for the first time.
- It should update that BehaviorSubject when the `update` function is called after the first time.
- It should cancel the subscriptions on `ngOnDestroy`.
- It should only emit new values when one or more **@Input()** properties have changed.

Let's dive in, the explanation of the code is added in the comments:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class InputStateModel<T> implements OnDestroy {
  // This injectable will get destroyed when the component who
  // provides it is destroyed, We will use the takeUntil operator
  // to cleanup every subscription to state$
  private readonly destroy$$ = new Subject<void>();

  // The update function will create the state$$ BehaviorSubject
  // We will use this initialized$$ BehaviorSubject to expose a state$ 
  // Observable when the InputStateModel is initialized
  private readonly initialized$$ = new BehaviorSubject<boolean>(false);

  // This will be created and nexted in the update function
  private state$$: BehaviorSubject<T>;

  // Expose a state$ observable when this instance is initialized
  public readonly state$: Observable<T> = this.initialized$$.pipe(
    filter(v => !!v), // Only when initialized
    switchMap(() => {
      // This is here to avoid typescript compilation issues
      if(!this.state$$){
        throw new Error('State must be initialized. Did you forgot to call the connect method?')
      }
      return this.state$$
    }),
    // Only emits when one or more of the @Input() properties change 
    distinctUntilChanged((previous: T, current: T) => {
      const keys = Object.keys(current);
      return keys.every(key => {
        return current[key] === previous[key]
      })
    }),
    // Clean up after ngOnDestroy
    takeUntil(this.destroy$$),
  )
  
  // Next the destroy$$ subject when this instance gets destroyed
  // This is used to avoid memory leaks
  public ngOnDestroy(): void {
    this.destroy$$.next();
  }

  public update(changes: TypedSimpleChanges<T>):void {
   const keys = Object.keys(changes);
    // If the state$$ BehaviorSubject is not created yet
    // (initial ngOnChanges):
    // Create a state for all @Input() properties
    // Create a new BehaviorSubject with that state,
    // and set the initialized$$ to true
    if (!this.state$$) {
      const state: T = {} as T;
      keys.forEach((key) => {
        state[key as keyof T] = changes[key].currentValue;
      });
      this.state$$ = new BehaviorSubject<T>(state);
      this.initialized$$.next(true);
    // If the state already exists:
    // Take the current state and only update the state if the current value
    // is different from the previous value
    } else {
      const state: T = { ...this.state$$?.value } as T;
      keys.forEach((key) => {
        if (changes[key].currentValue !== changes[key].previousValue) {
          state[key as keyof T] = changes[key].currentValue;
        }
      });
      // Only create one event for all @Input() properties
      this.state$$.next(state);
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. We can find a working [Stackblitz example of this code here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-w9bmdk?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpager%2Fpager.component.ts):

## Optimizing with a typescript Decorator

The current simplified version of the PagerComponent still has some boilerplate code we would like to reduce:

```typescript
@Component({â€¦
  providers: [InputStateModel] // Boilerplate
})
export class PagerComponent implements OnChanges {
  // Boilerplate
  private readonly inputStateModel = inject(InputStateModel<PagerInputState>);
  private readonly inputState$ = this.inputStateModel.state$;

  // Boilerplate
  public ngOnChanges(changes: TypedSimpleChanges<PagerInputState>): void {
    this.inputStateModel.update(changes);
  }
}
```

- We have to provide the `InputStateModel` in the `providers` property of `@Component`.
- We have to inject the `inputStateModel` and then extract the `state$` property from it.
- We have to implement `ngOnChanges` and update `this.inputStateModel` in there with the latest changes.

We would really love to reduce this to a one-liner that listens to `ngOnChanges`, `ngOnDestroy` but would still let us implement it in the pager component if we wanted to.
We could create an `@InputState()` decorator that does this for us and we would like to use it like this:

```typescript
@Component(...)
export class PagerComponent  {
  @InputState() private readonly inputState$!: Observable<PagerInputState>;
}
```
You can see the `!` syntax that will tell us that this property is always initialized because it would be the responsibility of the `@InputState()` decorator to initialize that observable.
This Decorator would use a variant of the `InputStateModel` to achieve everything we have accomplished before.

When using typescript property decorators it is important to realize that this decorator applies to the prototype of the class and not to the instance that is created of that class.

## Conclusion

- We have reduced the boilerplate code a lot
- We have hidden some RxJS complexities for the developer
- We now have an optimized state observable that we can easily use to create a ViewModel
- We don't have unwanted emissions or calculations
- A typescript property decorator is static, and we have to use a specific syntax to get a hold of `this`.
- Subscriptions are handled on `ngOnDestroy` and cleaned up automatically
- We can still implement the `ngOnChanges` and `ngOnDestroy` life cycle hooks if we want to but we don't have to

There are still a few problems though.
In the next article, we will fix the following problems:
- Our viewModel still contains properties our template doesn't need: (`pageIndex` and `itemsPerPage`)
- -The observable gets a new event every time an input property changes (in the same Change Detection cycle of course)
- How can we make this work together with other state?
