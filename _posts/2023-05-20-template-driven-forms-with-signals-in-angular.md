## Introduction

A while ago I wrote about why Angular template-driven forms beat Reactive forms because we let Angular do all the work for us.
After that I wrote how we could tackle model validations with vest suites.

Today we are going to look to the future of Angular and create an entire template-driven form completely supercharged with Signals.
