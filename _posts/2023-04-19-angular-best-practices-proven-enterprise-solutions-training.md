## What are Angular Best Practices?

What are Best Practices? That is hard to say because these principles are a matter of opinion.
There is no right or wrong when it comes to Angular Best Practices, and that goes for any other framework or library as well.
We believe Best Practices are related to experience. And experience is hard to learn, we need time for that!

That is why we call this training the **Angular Proven Enterprise Solutions** training. Because that is what we do at Simplified Courses. We help **Big companies** with **Big projects**. [Brecht Billiet](https://twitter.com/brechtbilliet){:target="_blank"} has helped companies all over the world with over 100 Angular projects and has been giving training/coaching in Angular before Angular2 was released.

We give this training [remotely](https://www.simplified.courses/remote-angular-proven-enterprise-solutions){:target="_blank"}, but also [on-site](https://www.simplified.courses/on-site-angular-training/angular-best-practices-course){:target="_blank"}. And the goal is to create an online product course as well at a lower price.
We have given this workshop at [ng-be conf](https://ng-be.org/){:target="_blank"} where we had a massive number of 54 attendees.

In this article, we will go over every chapter in our Angular Best Practices training and we will tackle some Best Practices in every chapter. Let's dive in.
